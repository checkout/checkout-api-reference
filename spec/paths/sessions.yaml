  summary: Request a session
  description: |
    A payment session is used to authenticate a cardholder before requesting a payment.
    Payment sessions are linked to one or more payments (in case of Merchant-initiated payments).

    Use `next_actions` from a successful response to identify what actions can be performed next.
